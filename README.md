# The-Odin-Project-Etch-a-Sketch

This simple web application allows users to create a sketch pad with a customizable grid of square divs. Users can hover over the squares to leave a pixelated trail, and there is an option to create a new grid with a specified number of squares per side.

## Features

- **Grid Creation:** A grid of square divs is dynamically created using JavaScript and displayed using flexbox.

- **Hover Effect:** The squares change color and undergo a progressive darkening effect when hovered over.

- **New Grid Button:** Users can click the "New Grid" button to input the number of squares per side for a new grid.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

2. Hover over the squares to see the color change and progressive darkening effect.

3. Click the "New Grid" button to create a new grid with a specified number of squares per side.

## Extra Credit Features

- **Random RGB Value:** Each interaction randomizes the square's RGB value entirely.

- **Progressive Darkening:** Each interaction adds 10% more black to the square, aiming for a completely black square after ten interactions.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file for creating the grid, handling hover events, and managing the new grid button.
